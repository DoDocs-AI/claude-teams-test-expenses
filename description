Claude Code Teams of Agents: Building a Full-Stack App with AI Agent Coordination

Watch how I built a complete Expense Tracker application from scratch using Claude Code's Teams of Agents feature — where multiple AI agents collaborate as a real development team.

In this video, you'll see how specialized AI agents work together in defined roles — Product Manager, UX Expert, Architect, Scrum Master, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Tech Lead, Manual Tester, and QA Engineer — each handling their part of the software development lifecycle autonomously.

The result: a full-stack expense tracking app with a Quarkus/Java backend, React/TypeScript frontend, PostgreSQL database, JWT authentication, budget management, category filtering, and reporting dashboards — all coordinated by AI agents.

What you'll learn:
- How to set up Claude Code Teams of Agents for a real project
- Defining agent roles and responsibilities with CLAUDE.md
- Multi-agent coordination: from requirements gathering to testing
- Full-stack development with AI: backend API, frontend UI, database design
- Automated testing with Playwright browser automation

Tech stack: Quarkus (Java), React + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Vite

About this channel:

Welcome to a channel focused on AI Coding, Artificial Intelligence, and Modern Software Development.
This channel explores how developers can use AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude Code, Open Code, GitHub Copilot, Large Language Models (LLMs), and automation frameworks to build real-world software faster and smarter. I share hands-on experiments, coding tutorials, and practical demonstrations showing how AI is transforming programming and developer workflows.

On this channel, you will learn about:
✅ AI-assisted coding and AI code generation
✅ Prompt engineering for developers
✅ Building applications using Large Language Models (LLMs)
✅ Software architecture and system design with AI
✅ Automation of development workflows and DevOps
✅ Cloud development, APIs, and microservices
✅ Testing, debugging, and optimizing AI-generated code
✅ Real-world experiments with ChatGPT, Claude Code, Open Code, and other AI coding assistants
✅ Productivity tips for software engineers
